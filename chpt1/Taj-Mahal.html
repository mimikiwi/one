    <p class="text">The Great Wall of China is a series of forts
    equipped with weapons, filled in with a 6 to 7 meter tall wall in between. It is 21,000 km, or 13,000 miles long. It is 2nd oldest of the 7 Wonders, as it was built in 7 BC, or 2,700 years ago. This wall was built to protect China, but it didn't always succeed in its job. It travels along 15 regions in North China: from Heilongjiang to Xinjiang. 1/3 of the Wall has already disappeared. More than 1 million laborers were recruited to help build this giant wall. As a popular tourist attraction, more than 50 million visitors come to see the wall every year!</p>
