      <p class="text">Petra, also known as the <q>Rose City</q> is a famous archaeological site in Jordan's desert.  It contains temples and tombs carved into pink sandstone rock. It is the oldest of the 7 Wonders, as it was built in 300 BC. However, even though it was so old, it was only discovered in 1812, by a Swiss Explorer named Ludwig Burckhardt! Petra is well known for its architecture and water system. Petra's name came from the feminine version of the Greek word Petros, which means rocks. This is because Petra is literally carved into the rock, surrounded by mountains and passages It was an ancient city that was actually inhabited by people.
